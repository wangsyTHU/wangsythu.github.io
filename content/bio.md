I am now a Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Associate at Cornell University in [PEESE Lab](https://www.peese.org/), led by [Prof. Fengqi You](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/people/fengqi-you/). Previously, I was an Ezra Postdoctoral Associate in Energy Systems at Cornell University. I obtained my Ph.D. from the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm) at Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Wenchuan Wu](https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/faculties/wuwench.htm) (IEEE Fellow), in the [EMS Lab](https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1009/1780.htm) led by [Prof. Hongbin Sun](https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/faculties/shb.htm) (Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences).

My research focuses on improving and applying AI and optimization to enhance the secure and efficient operation of energy systems in the transition to a low-carbon future. My work includes:

* Apply AI and optimization to enhance the security and efficiency of energy systems.
* Quantify the flexibility of distributed and integrated energy resources.
* Model and optimize emerging large electric loads.
* Monitor system operations using AI and multimodal sensing data.
* Provide policy insights to support the low-carbon energy transition.
